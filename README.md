This exercise was carried out during my web developer courses at BeCode Li√®ge

 
 ## Goals :
 - Create an animated menu only with HTML/CSS
 - Find documentation on animations
 
 ## Expected result :

 ## How did I do it ?
 
I used two methods. I started by changing the width when animating. This technique was good but I modified the code to practice. I ended up using the z-index as well as the translate property. I had no knowledge of animations with CSS. It was a good exercise
